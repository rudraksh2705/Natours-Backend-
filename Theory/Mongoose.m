ODM library jo structure provide krti hai

ðŸ“¦ What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

It provides a structured, schema-based solution to define and interact with MongoDB documents using JavaScript in a more controlled, organized way.

âœ… Why Use Mongoose?
MongoDB is schema-less by default (you can store anything in any format). But in real applications, you want control and structure â€” thatâ€™s where Mongoose comes in.
