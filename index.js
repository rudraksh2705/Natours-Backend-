Req

req represents the HTTP request received by the server.
It contains all information sent by the client (browser, Postman, frontend app, etc.)

Common properties:
req.body â†’ Data sent in body (used in POST, PATCH)
req.params â†’ Route parameters like /api/:id
req.query â†’ Query string parameters like ?search=apple
req.method â†’ Request type: GET, POST, etc.
req.headers â†’ Metadata like content type, authorization, etc.
ðŸ”¸ "req is used to read incoming data from the client."


Res->
res (Response Object)
res is used to send a response back to the client.
Common methods:
res.send() â†’ Sends plain text or data
res.json() â†’ Sends JSON data
res.status() â†’ Sets the HTTP status code
res.redirect() â†’ Redirects to another URL
res.end() â†’ Ends the response without data
ðŸ”¸ "res is used to send data or status back to the client."

/*
Middleware in Express is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and the next middleware in the cycle (next). It is used to modify req or res, handle errors, or run code before sending a response.
Everything is Middlware
Order is defined by the order they are defined in stack
Req and resp obj goes through each middleware
Next func is called to execute next middleware
Like a pipeline

//Rest Architecture
/*
1)Seperate API to logical resources
Obj or repre of something , which has data associated , any info can be called resource

2)should contain resource based url

3)we should use HTTP methods(CRUD Oprn)
Get-> perfom read oprn
Post-> Create new resources
Put/Patch-> Update resources 
Put->entire updated data
Patch-> expect the properties
Delete-> Delete Resource

4)send Data as JSON
lightweight data interchange format

5)Be Stateless
server should not remember prev state
